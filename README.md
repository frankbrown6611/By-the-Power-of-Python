Documenting what I learn about Python fundamentals


1. [For Loop](#for-loop)


## [For Loop](https://wiki.python.org/moin/ForLoop)

`For` is an iteration keyword in Python. Keywords are reserved in Python so they can't be used as a variable, function, or other identifier. 

A `For` Loop repeats (iterates) a block of code for each item within a sequence, also known as an iterable object which are list, tuple, dictionary, range, or strings. 

There are 4 parts to a `For` Loop:
- The iterator variable
- The `in` operator
- The sequence to iterate over
- The block of code to execute for each item in the sequence
