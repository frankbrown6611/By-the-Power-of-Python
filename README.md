1. [For Loop](#for-loop)


## [For Loop](https://wiki.python.org/moin/ForLoop)

`For` is an iteration keyword in Python. Keywords are reserved in Python so they can't be used as a variable, function, or other identifier. 
A `For` Loop repeats (iterates) a block of code within an iterable object such as list, tuple, dictionary, range, or strings.
